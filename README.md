A sample project for my blog post post [How to: create your SUPER simple dependency injector framework in Swift](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2020/03/19/dependecy-injection-swift/), where I show how to create a simple dependecies injector container in Swift. 

### Description

This is a quote from the post:

> ...We have a lot of alternatives from which we can choose: [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject "dependecies injection swift Swinject"), [Weaver](https://github.com/scribd/Weaver "dependecies injection swift Weaver") etc. This frameworks come with a lot of features like: object graph construction, injection with property wrappers, instance persistence etc. This are all useful feature, but if your needs are very limited (just a dependecies container register/resolver using protocol and classes) the previous frameworks gives you just a big overhead and complexity on you code. This is why for my recent project I tried to write my own very simple dependencies injector container by leveraging the power of Swift Metatype and the Hashable protocol. Let's go and see the how I created it...
